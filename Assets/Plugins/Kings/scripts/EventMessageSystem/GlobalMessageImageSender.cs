/*
 * 'GlobalMessageImageSender' is usually called by an unity event.
 * It transmitts a sprite to all 'GlobalMessageEventReceiver' scripts which are
 * registered at the 'GlobalMessageEventManager' (creation of the manager and
 * registering of the receivers happens automatically, if at least one receiver is or was 
 * within the scene).
 * 
 * The messages, which will trigger image replacement, can be transmitted over
 * multible loaded scenes and will also reach spawned gameobjects (the gameobjects must 
 * be activated). 
 * 
 * To send a message within a script, use 'GlobalMessageEventManager.sendToReceivers ("yourMessage");'.
