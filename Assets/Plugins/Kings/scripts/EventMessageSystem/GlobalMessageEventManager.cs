/*
 * GlobalMessageEventManager collects receivers for string messages 
 * (like triggers of an animator) and distributes the messages to them.
 * Depending on the message, the receiver calls an unity event.
 * 
 * The Manger is automatically created as an "DontDestroyOnLoad" - gameobject,
 * if any receiver is or was in scene. You should NOT add it manually to an gameobject. 
 * Because of this structure, messages can be transmitted over multible opened scenes.
